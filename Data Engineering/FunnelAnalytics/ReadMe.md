**Scenario:**
My boss approached me with a unique opportunity to showcase my skills and make an impact in a pilot program for a non-profit organization selling online products. The business had been collecting data in separate, unstructured Excel files that lacked meaningful insights. My boss needed someone to transform this fragmented data into something valuable, with the ultimate goal of understanding the customer journey better. 

The challenge was clear: use my expertise to convert these isolated files into actionable insights that could help the non-profit make data-driven decisions. The objective was to extract 3 impactful insights for the pilot phase and propose 3 additional ideas to discuss further, all aimed at enhancing the business's understanding of their customers and improving their strategies moving forward.

**Key Objectives:**
- **Integrate and clean data** from multiple Excel files.
- **Build a data pipeline** to transform raw data into a usable format.
- Provide **3 impactful insights** to help the business understand the customer journey.
- Propose **3 ideas for further exploration** to enhance the customer experience and decision-making.

**Project Highlights:**
- **Data Sources**: Multiple separate Excel files provided by the business.
- **Data Pipeline**: Combines, cleans, and enriches customer journey data.
- **Data Transformation**: Merging fact and dimension tables for meaningful analysis.
- **Technology**: Python (pandas), Snowflake for data storage and analytics.

**3 Key Insights:**
1. **Customer Segmentation**: Identify different customer types based on browsing behavior.
2. **Sales Funnel Drop-off Points**: Analyze where in the customer journey most potential customers exit the process.
3. **Device Preferences**: Determine which devices (mobile, desktop) are most commonly used by customers.

**3 Ideas for Further Exploration:**
1. **Personalized Marketing Campaigns**: Develop strategies for targeting customer segments with personalized content.
2. **Customer Retention Analysis**: Investigate patterns in repeat customers and ways to increase retention.
3. **A/B Testing for Website Optimization**: Test changes to the website to improve conversion rates at key points in the customer journey.
