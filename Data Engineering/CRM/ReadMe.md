This is an end-to-end Azure & Snowflake analytics engineering project where I used Python, SnowSQL, SnowPark, and Power BI to create a data solution. Multiple CRM files are read from local storage and pushed to Azure Data Lake Gen2. From there, I used SnowSQL to build a virtual data warehouse to stage and manage my data. SnowPark was used to transform and clean the data. Power BI was used as the visualization tool for analytical consumption.
